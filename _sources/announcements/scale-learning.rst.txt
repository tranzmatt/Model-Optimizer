How we set scales in blockwise quantization plays an important role in
determining the quality of the quantized model. In this blog we introduce scale
learning, which makes NVFP4 per-block scales trainable parameters and learns
optimal per-block scales through a training loop.

There are two types of scale learning: scale-only learning and full parameter
scale learning. In scale-only learning, we train only scales and leave weights
frozen. We can think of this as an enhancement of scale setting methods based
on search like MSE or Local-Hessian, where we use scale setting to initialize
scales, and then run scale-only learning to further optimize them.

In full parameter scale learning, we co-train scales and weights together. This
can serve as an enhancement of traditional Quantization-Aware Distillation
(QAD) with additional trainable parameters.


How Scale Learning Works
************************

The idea of scale learning is to make the NVFP4 per-block scales trainable. We
need to be able to compute the gradient of a loss function :math:`L` with
respect to a per-block scale :math:`s` via backpropagation. We use the usual
QAT approach, where we do fake-quantization in the forward pass and
backpropagate with straight-through estimators. During a forward pass,
instead of a weight :math:`x` we use a fake-quantized weight
:math:`\tilde{x}`, given by

.. math::

   \tilde{x} = s \cdot \operatorname{clamp}\!\left(
   \operatorname{round}\!\left(\frac{x}{s}\right), q_{\min}, q_{\max}\right).

Here :math:`x` is a single weight and :math:`s` its corresponding scale
(omitting the global scale for simplicity). In NVFP4 [1]_, every block of
sixteen weights shares a single scale, :math:`q_{\min}` and :math:`q_{\max}`
are :math:`-6` and :math:`6` respectively, and :math:`\operatorname{round}`
rounds to the nearest E2M1 value.

To train the scale we need :math:`\partial L/\partial s`, which we can compute
via the chain rule:

.. math::

   \frac{\partial L}{\partial s}
   = \sum_{\tilde{x} \in s\text{-block}}
     \frac{\partial L}{\partial \tilde{x}} \cdot
     \frac{\partial \tilde{x}}{\partial s}.

:math:`\partial L/\partial \tilde{x}` can be computed via backpropagation the
usual way in neural network training. To compute
:math:`\partial\tilde{x}/\partial s` we use a straight-through estimator: the
derivative of :math:`\operatorname{round}` is taken to be 1. Applying the
product rule to :math:`s \cdot \operatorname{round}\!\left(\tfrac{x}{s}\right)`
then yields

.. math::

   \frac{\partial \tilde{x}}{\partial s}
   = \begin{cases}
       q_{\min}, & \dfrac{x}{s} < q_{\min}, \\[2ex]
       \operatorname{round}\!\left(\dfrac{x}{s}\right) - \dfrac{x}{s},
         & q_{\min} \le \dfrac{x}{s} \le q_{\max}, \\[2ex]
       q_{\max}, & q_{\max} < \dfrac{x}{s}.
     \end{cases}

This is the general idea, although it is slightly more complicated since the
scale :math:`s` is also quantized (to FP8), so we have to apply
straight-through estimators there as well.

We also have a version of scale learning with "dual scales", where during fake
quantization the scale we divide by (the "pre-scale") and the scale we later
multiply by (the "post-scale") are independent. In other words,

.. math::

   \tilde{x} = s_{\mathrm{post}} \cdot \operatorname{clamp}\!\left(
   \operatorname{round}\!\left(\frac{x}{s_{\mathrm{pre}}}\right),
   q_{\min}, q_{\max}\right).

Then we can compute partial derivatives the same way as before, and obtain

.. math::

   \frac{\partial \tilde{x}}{\partial s_{\mathrm{post}}}
   = \operatorname{clamp}\!\left(
   \operatorname{round}\!\left(\frac{x}{s_{\mathrm{pre}}}\right),
   q_{\min}, q_{\max}\right)

and

.. math::

   \frac{\partial \tilde{x}}{\partial s_{\mathrm{pre}}}
   = \begin{cases}
       0, & \dfrac{x}{s_{\mathrm{pre}}} < q_{\min}, \\[2ex]
       -\,\dfrac{s_{\mathrm{post}}\, x}{s_{\mathrm{pre}}^{2}},
         & q_{\min} \le \dfrac{x}{s_{\mathrm{pre}}} \le q_{\max}, \\[2ex]
       0, & q_{\max} < \dfrac{x}{s_{\mathrm{pre}}}.
     \end{cases}

During export, the post-scale is baked into the checkpoint and the pre-scale is
discarded.

ModelOpt implements both forms via the
:func:`lsq <modelopt.torch.quantization.model_calib.lsq>` API [2]_. In the
implementation we reparameterize the trained quantity as ``amax`` rather than
the scale itself.
The field ``tied_amax`` controls whether we have dual scales or a single "tied"
scale. (i.e. we set ``tied_amax: false`` for dual scales).

Nemotron 3.5 Lightning
======================

Scale-only learning can significantly improve accuracy of NVFP4 quantized
Nemotron 3.5 Lightning. In this example, the PTQ recipe is W4A4 routed experts
and W8A8 attention and Mamba cache, using MSE for scale setting.

After PTQ, we run scale-only QAD. Plotting the train and validation loss, we
see stable convergence:

.. image:: assets/W4A4-scale-only-loss.png
   :alt: Train and validation KL loss falling from 0.090 at iteration 0 to
         about 0.045 by iteration 175 during W4A4 scale-only learning

Table 1 compares scale-only learning against the PTQ baseline on Nemotron 3.5
Lightning, with the BF16 model as reference, on various benchmarks.

Recommendations
***************

In general, we have found that scale-only learning is a highly useful technique
and outperforms traditional scale setting methods and recovers more accuracy,
across a variety of models and contexts. It improves accuracy more consistently
than QAD, which can cause regressions on benchmarks as the weights shift during
training. Full parameter scale learning can outperform ordinary QAD (i.e.
with frozen scales) for many models in our experiments, but doesn't work for
all models.

A higher learning rate is needed for scales: we recommend 1e-4. A smaller
number of steps (sometimes just 50) is needed for scale-only learning to
converge compared to QAT/QAD. Dual scales sometimes outperforms tied scales,
but for other models can cause distribution shift where tied scales improves
accuracy: neither is universally better.


Using Scale Learning
********************

Scale learning is a training-time algorithm: the scales are learnt during
QAT/QAD, so these recipes are not usable as calibration-only PTQ. Scale-only
learning involves 1/16th as many trainable parameters as regular QAT/QAD, so it
uses a sixteenth of the gradient state and optimizer memory. Since we need to
still compute all partial derivatives with respect to the fake-quant weights,
the compute requirement is the same (although we tend to need fewer steps for
scale-only learning).

After scales are learnt, there is no deployment cost -- learned scales are
folded into the exported checkpoint and are the same FP8 block scales the
format already carries, so the deployed graph is unchanged.

To use it in your own configuration, set the ``algorithm`` field:

.. code-block:: python

   import modelopt.torch.quantization as mtq

   config = {
       "quant_cfg": [...],  # quantizer configuration
       "algorithm": {
           "method": "lsq",
           "learnable_amax": ["pre", "post"],
           "tied_amax": True,
           "scale_algorithm": {"method": "mse", "fp8_scale_sweep": True},
       },
   }

   model = mtq.quantize(model, config, forward_loop)

See :ref:`quant-cfg` for how to write the ``quant_cfg`` field, and the
:func:`lsq API <modelopt.torch.quantization.model_calib.lsq>` for the
calibration entry point.

This call configures fake quantization and initializes the learnable scales; it
does not train them. Continue with QAT or QAD, updating only scale parameters
for scale-only learning or both weights and scales for full parameter scale
learning.

The shipped recipes cover the two variants:

- ``modelopt_recipes/general/qad/nvfp4_lsq-mse_init-fp8_kv.yaml`` — one shared
  pre- and post-quantization scale.
- ``modelopt_recipes/general/qad/nvfp4_dual_lsq-mse_init-fp8_kv.yaml``
  — separate pre- and post-quantization scales.

With the ``examples/llm_qat`` entry points, run from that directory:

.. code-block:: bash

   # 1. Quantize. The LSQ recipe initializes the block scales with MSE and
   #    installs the learnable amax parameters.
   python quantize.py \
     --model_name_or_path Qwen/Qwen3-8B \
     --dataset_config configs/dataset/blend.yaml \
     --recipe general/qad/nvfp4_lsq-mse_init-fp8_kv \
     --output_dir qwen3-8b-lsq-quantized

   # 2. Scale-only learning. Trains just the amax parameters installed above,
   #    distilling from the BF16 model.
   accelerate launch --config-file configs/accelerate/fsdp2.yaml train.py \
     --config configs/train/qad_scale_only.yaml \
     --model_name_or_path qwen3-8b-lsq-quantized \
     --teacher_model Qwen/Qwen3-8B \
     --output_dir qwen3-8b-scale-only

   # 3. Export for deployment.
   python export.py \
     --pyt_ckpt_path qwen3-8b-scale-only \
     --export_path qwen3-8b-scale-only-deploy

For full parameter scale learning, swap the step 2 config for
``configs/train/qad_with_learnt_amax.yaml``, which trains weights and scales
together. For dual scales, swap the step 1 recipe for
``general/qad/nvfp4_dual_lsq-mse_init-fp8_kv``.


Next steps
**********

Current Model-Optimizer scale learning implementation only applies to NVFP4
per-block weight scales. In the future, we can apply the idea of scale learning
to global weight scales, or (global) input activation scales. There is
potential to optimize these through training as well.
